# Getting Started

**Welcome to Cosmos EVM develop documentation!** This documents are in maintenance, due to the recent migration from evmOS to the maintenance of this fork by the Interchain Labs team.

Learn about:

1. Building and deploying [EVM Smart Contracts](./develop/smart-contracts)
2. Integrating [wallets](./develop/wallet-integration) (e.g. Keplr and MetaMask) into your Frontend
4. Available developer [Tools](./tools/index.md)

## Contributors

You can also contribute to the Evmos ecosystem without building a dApp. Head over to [tools](./tools/index.md) to learn
how to contribute as a full-stack developer by building new dev tools or [protocol](../protocol) to help
out building the core protocol.
