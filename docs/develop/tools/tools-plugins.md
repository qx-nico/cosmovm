# Tools and IDE Plugins

## Smart Contract Development Tools

- [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.17+commit.8df45f5f.js)
is a free, browser-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
It is designed to make it easier for developers to get started with building decentralized applications (dapps)
by providing a simple and user-friendly interface for writing and deploying smart contracts.
With Remix, you can write, test, and deploy smart contracts written in Solidity.
It also includes debugging tools and a simulation environment
for testing contracts before deploying them to the blockchain.
The tool provides plugins as well.
[Drizzle](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/drizzle/) packs frontend libraries
that enables standard-compliant wallet connection, account,
and contract state management through React components.
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) is RUST toolkit that enables fast, portable,
and modular application development for Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains.
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is a JS/TS library that allow comprehensive testing, development, and deploying smart contracts.
Hardhat contains many [plugins](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins) to aid further developments.

## Open Sourced Contracts

- [OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/contracts) contains battle-tested libraries of smart contracts
for Ethereum-compatible chains and includes the most used ERC standards.

## IDE

- [Hardhat for VSCode](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-vscode/docs/overview) is a Visual Studio Code extension
that simplifies how you create, build, debug,
and deploy smart contracts on Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains.
